# GEARS
Team 70's repository for GEARS code for ENGR162 Project 3
This will be used to store all of the code for this project, from prototyping to final product
If you are seeing this and you are not a part of Team 70, you are likely in violation of the engineering code of ethics.

For those on team 70:

The branch hierarchy structure is given in the respective image file

All file descriptions and the code structure is in the pdf

Every time you edit an unedited file, create a branch for it if one doesn't exist.

Every time you start a new feature for that file, create a new branch for it with the naming convention "file_name_feature"

When you are done implementing the feature, merge it back with the main branch of that file

Once it has been shown to work in the main branch for that file, merge the file branch with the main branch for its section
    (ie gps, dribing, interfacing, hazards)

Once that segment has been proven to work properly, we then and only then merge it with master

When it comes for the final iterations, we will create a new submission branch which will supercede master and contain all of the final files


If you have any questions, call Ben, he can probably answer them.
Remember to commit early and commit often, that's our failsafe if anything goes wrong.
Along those lines, make sure that your commit names are very detailed so troubleshooting is easy.
