# equal participant in its creation. In addition, each
# member of the team has a general understanding of
# all aspects of the program development and execution.
# 
# Responsible for actually navigating the maze. Will most likely implement DFS with Backtracking. 
# At any given location, takes corridor existences and creates data structures to store the form of the maze. 
# Also outputs the next direction/set of instructions for the GEARS to properly navigate the maze. 
# Still need to determine if this is what handles backtracking.
# Inputs: Relative Wall Data, Hazard Data, Path Existence
# Outputs: Maze Navigation, Maze Data Structure.
